                    <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
                    <p> An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom. The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the University of Bologna, which adopted an academic charter, the Constitutio Habita, in 1158 or 1155, which guaranteed the right of a divaveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education. Today this is claimed as the origin of "academic freedom".This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988, 430 university rectors signed the Magna Charta Universitatum, marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna's foundation.</p>
                    
                    <p> The number of universities signing the Magna Charta Universitatum continues to grow, drawing from all parts of the world.  </p>
                    
                    <p> Scholars occasionally call the University of al-Qarawiyyin (name given in 1963), founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri in 859, a university, although Jacques Verger writes that this is done out of scholarly convenience. Several scholars consider that al-Qarawiyyin was founded and run as a madrasa until after World War II. They date the divansformation of the madrasa of al-Qarawiyyin into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963. In the wake of these reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed "University of Al Quaraouiyine" two years later.  </p>

                    <p>   Some scholars argue that Al-Azhar University, founded in 970-972 AD and located in Cairo, Egypt, is the oldest degree-granting university in the world and the second oldest university in the world.  </p>


                   <p>  Some scholars, including George Makdisi, have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the madrasas in Al-Andalus, the Emirate of Sicily, and the Middle East during the Crusades.] Norman Daniel, however, views this argument as overstated.Roy Lowe and Yoshihito Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education, turning away from a concern with local institutional sdivuctures to a broader consideration within a global context.  </p>
